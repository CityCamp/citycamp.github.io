We developed the CityCamp website template to support organizers who don't want to build a custom website.

- [Example CityCamp website](https://afomi.github.io/citycamp-template)

## Steps

1. Fork the [template website repository](https://github.com/afomi/citycamp-template) to get started with your own website.
1. Follow the [README](https://github.com/afomi/citycamp-template/blob/main/README.md) in the template to customize your website and host it on GitHub pages.
1. [Request a CityCamp subdomain](/subdomain-request) for your city.
