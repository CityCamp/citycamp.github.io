## What is an unconference 🌀  
An unconference is a meeting with no set speakers or agenda. Instead, people come together, suggest topics, and join open sessions. Anyone can lead a talk or join one.  

These events are used around the world—in schools, tech, government, and communities. [CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/) is one popular example focused on local civic tech and open government.

## Why run an unconference 🌱  
Unconferences are great for sharing ideas, solving problems, and building new things.  

They’re easy to organize. You don’t need speakers, panels, or tons of planning. People who show up shape the content together. That makes every event unique.  

They’re used for:  
- Improving cities and local government ([CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/))  
- Teaching and learning ([EdCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdCamp))  
- Tech and startups ([BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp))  
- Open data and policy ([Transparency Camp](https://sunlightfoundation.com/transparency-camp/how-to/))

## How it works 🔍  
Here’s what usually happens:  
- People gather and suggest session topics  
- Ideas are posted on a wall or board  
- A schedule is built together  
- Sessions begin—anyone can lead, anyone can join  

No slides required. Just real conversations. If a session isn’t working for you, you can leave and try another. That’s the “rule of two feet.”

## General rules for unconferences 🎯  
- **Whoever shows up are the right people**  
- **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have**  
- **It starts when it starts**  
- **The law of two feet** — if you’re not learning or contributing, move to another session  
- **No spectators—only participants**  
- **No pitching** — this is a space for sharing, not selling

## For organizers 🛠️  
Running an unconference is easier than you think. Here’s how to do it:

**Before the event:**  
- Choose a topic (e.g., civic tech, education, design)  
- Find a venue with open rooms and flexible space  
- Spread the word and explain the format clearly  
- Share a Code of Conduct  
- Gather supplies: sticky notes, markers, tape, whiteboards, name tags  

**At the event:**  
- Welcome people and explain the rules  
- Build the schedule together  
- Keep the vibe relaxed and open

Make the most of your day by showing up ready to engage.  

Tips:  
- Bring your curiosity and your voice  
- Don’t be shy—write down a session idea  
- It’s okay to move between sessions  
- Take notes, make friends, ask questions

## Choosing a venue 🏕️  
You don’t need fancy. You need flexible.

**Must-have features:**  
- A big room for everyone to start together  
- Three or more breakout areas for sessions  
- Wall space to post a session grid  
- Moveable chairs and tables  

**Helpful extras:**  
- Wi-Fi  
- Outlets  
- Accessible restrooms  
- Water and snacks  
- Quiet spaces  
- Signs to help people find rooms  

Many CityCamps happen in libraries, community centers, schools, or coworking spaces.

## Respect and safety 🤝  
Make sure everyone feels safe and welcome.

Before the event, share a **Code of Conduct** like the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://citizencodeofconduct.org/). Include it in your invites, on your website, and in the room.  

Your code should say:  
- Be kind  
- Be respectful  
- No harassment or hate  
- Speak up if you see something wrong  
- Find an organizer if help is needed  

Go over it at the start of the day. Then model it all day.

## Types of unconferences 🧭

- [**CityCamp**](https://citycamp.com/): Civic tech, cities, public service  
- [**Transparency Camp**](https://sunlightfoundation.com/transparency-camp/how-to/): Open data, democracy, and accountability  
- [**EdCamp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdCamp): Education, teachers, learning

Each one keeps the format flexible and participant-led.
