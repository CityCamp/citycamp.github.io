CityCamp is an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference "wikipedia") focused on innovation for municipal governments and community organizations.  As an unconference, content for CityCamp is not programmed for a passive audience.

Instead, content is created and organized by participants and coordinated by facilitators. Participants are expected to play active roles in sessions. This provides an excellent format for creative, open exchange geared toward action.

The first CityCamp was held in Chicago, Illinois, 23-24 January, 2010. Since then, there have been events worldwide.

## Open source

CityCamp is an open source brand that exists in the [Creative Commons](/license). Open source ensures that CityCamp is maintained as a pattern that is easily repeatable and for anyone to use. Branding ensures that the pattern is recognizable and that independent organizers don’t misrepresent CityCamp. No one organization will own CityCamp. Instead it will be maintained by the CityCamp community supported by a cadre of local community organizers.
