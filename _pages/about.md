CityCamp is a global movement of community-focused events that foster civic collaboration and innovation. These events bring people together to improve their communities. Everyone is welcome to join and share their ideas and skills to help make their city a better place.

## History

The first CityCamp was organized by Kevin Curry and Jen Pahlka and held January 23-24, 2010, in Chicago, Illinois. Afterwards, Kevin and Luke Fretwell developed it as an open source brand so that anyone could host events anywhere. Since then, there have been self-organized [CityCamp events worldwide](/cities).

## World CityCamp Day

World CityCamp Day is held on the third Saturday of September.

While some cities hold CityCamps throughout the year, World CityCamp Day brings together the global CityCamp community to celebrate their efforts. Some cities hold official CityCamps at this time, while others use it to plan for a future event.
