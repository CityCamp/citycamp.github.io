## Website template

We developed the CityCamp website template to support organizers who don't want to build a custom website.

- [Example CityCamp website](https:///citycamp-website-template.citycamp.com)

1. Fork the [CityCamp website template repository](https://github.com/citycamp/citycamp-website-template).
1. Follow the [README](https://github.com/citycamp/citycamp-website-template/blob/main/README.md) instructions to customize and host your website on GitHub pages.
1. Request a CityCamp subdomain (below).

## Subdomain request

To help event organizers better promote their events without needing to purchase a domain, we support citycamp.com subdomains (ex: nyc.citycamp.com).

- [Submit a subdomain request](https://github.com/CityCamp/citycamp.github.io/issues/new/choose) (GitHub)
