An unconference is a participant-driven meeting format where attendees collaboratively create the agenda, lead sessions, and shape discussions around shared interests. Unlike traditional conferences with predetermined speakers and rigid schedules, unconferences harness collective intelligence to address real community challenges and foster meaningful civic engagement.

This format has proven particularly effective for civic engagement, community organizing, and collaborative problem-solving. CityCamp events worldwide use this approach to bring together citizens, activists, educators, designers, and government officials to improve local communities through open dialogue and collective action.

## What is an unconference: definition and core principles üéØ

An unconference is a meeting with no set speakers or predetermined agenda. Instead, people come together, suggest topics based on their interests and expertise, and participate in open sessions. Anyone can lead a discussion or join one that interests them.

These participant-driven events are used around the world‚Äîin schools, community organizations, government offices, and civic groups. [CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/) is one popular example focused on local civic engagement and community problem-solving through collaborative discussion and action planning.

## Benefits of organizing unconferences for communities and organizations üå±

Unconferences excel at fostering genuine dialogue, collaborative problem-solving, and building stronger community networks. They create space for voices that might not be heard in traditional meeting formats.

They're accessible to organize. You don't need keynote speakers, elaborate staging, or extensive advance planning. People who attend shape the content together, making every event unique and responsive to current community needs.

**What makes unconferences particularly valuable is the incredible diversity of content they generate. Unlike traditional conferences where content is decided by organizers, unconferences often produce more timely, interesting, and occasionally unusual topics that truly reflect what participants want to discuss.**

Unconferences are particularly effective for:

- Improving cities and local government engagement ([CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/))
- Educational innovation and peer learning ([EdCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdCamp))
- Technology and innovation discussions ([BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp))
- Government transparency and civic participation ([Transparency Camp](https://sunlightfoundation.com/transparency-camp/how-to/))
- Community organizing and social justice initiatives
- Neighborhood planning and local development

## Unconference format: step-by-step process guide üîÑ

Here's what typically happens at a successful unconference:

- **Gathering and topic generation**: Participants arrive and suggest session topics based on their interests, challenges, or expertise
- **Collaborative scheduling**: Ideas are posted on a visible wall or board, and a schedule is built together through group discussion
- **Session formation**: Participants self-organize into discussion groups around the topics that most interest them
- **Open dialogue**: Sessions begin with anyone able to lead and anyone free to join, leave, or move between discussions

No formal presentations required‚Äîjust authentic conversations and collaborative thinking. If a session isn't valuable for you, you can leave and try another. This flexibility is known as the "law of two feet."

## Core principles and guidelines for unconferences ‚öñÔ∏è

- **Whoever shows up are the right people**: The participants present are exactly who should be there
- **Whatever happens is what was meant to happen**: Embrace the organic nature of discussions
- **It starts when it starts**: Allow natural timing rather than rigid schedules
- **The law of two feet**: If you're not learning or contributing, move to another session
- **No spectators, only participants**: Everyone is encouraged to engage actively
- **No pitching or selling**: This is a space for sharing knowledge and building community, not promoting products or services

## Complete organizer guide: planning your unconference üõ†Ô∏è

Running an unconference requires less advance planning than traditional conferences but benefits from thoughtful preparation. Here's your step-by-step organizing guide:

### Before your event: planning phase üìã

- **Define your focus**: Choose a theme that will attract engaged participants (civic engagement, education innovation, community development, local government reform)
- **Secure your venue**: Find a location with flexible spaces and moveable furniture (see venue selection guide below)
- **Build your community**: Spread the word through local networks, community organizations, and social media, clearly explaining the unconference format
- **Establish safety guidelines**: Create and share a Code of Conduct that ensures all participants feel welcome and safe
- **Gather essential supplies**: Stock up on sticky notes, markers, masking tape, flip chart paper, name tags, and basic refreshments

**Pro tip: Encourage pre-event connection by creating opportunities for potential attendees to connect on social media and start discussing potential session topics. This helps people arrive with ideas already formed and can spark creative collaboration before the event even begins.**

### During your event: facilitation üé™

- **Welcome and orientation**: Explain the unconference format and review community guidelines with all participants
- **Collaborative agenda building**: Facilitate the process of topic suggestion and schedule creation
- **Maintain open atmosphere**: Keep the environment welcoming and encourage participation from quieter voices
- **Support session leaders**: Help discussions get started and provide gentle guidance when needed
- **Document the experience**: Take photos (with permission) and notes to share with the community afterward

**Key facilitation insight: Help newcomers feel comfortable by pairing them with experienced participants or organizers. Remember that everyone was new at some point, and reducing first-time anxiety leads to better participation.**

### After your event: follow-up üåà

- **Express gratitude**: Thank participants, venue hosts, and any sponsors or supporters
- **Share resources**: Distribute session notes, contact information, and relevant links from discussions
- **Gather feedback**: Ask participants what worked well and what could be improved for future events
- **Maintain momentum**: Keep your community connected through follow-up meetings, online groups, or collaborative projects

## Maximizing participant engagement and experience üöÄ

The success of your unconference depends on active, engaged participants. Here's how to help attendees make the most of the experience:

### Tips for participants üí°

**Before the event:**
- **Come prepared with session ideas**: Don't wait until the scheduling moment to think about what topics you'd like to propose. Consider reaching out to past attendees or using social media to get feedback on potential topics
- **Network early**: Arrive a bit early to meet other attendees and bounce session ideas off them. These pre-event conversations often lead to the most creative session concepts

**During the event:**
- **Come with curiosity**: Bring your questions, challenges, and genuine interest in learning from others
- **Contribute your voice**: Don't hesitate to suggest a session topic, even if you don't consider yourself an expert
- **Practice flexibility**: Move between sessions freely to find the conversations that most interest you
- **Make your session cards stand out**: Use colorful pens, stickers, creative artwork, or even small decorative items to help your session card catch attention on the scheduling board
- **Network confidently**: Don't be nervous about joining conversations. If you overhear an interesting discussion, simply ask "Do you mind if I join the conversation?"
- **Document and connect**: Take notes, exchange contact information, and ask thoughtful questions
- **Lead by example**: You don't need credentials to facilitate a valuable discussion‚Äîjust genuine interest and good questions
- **Ask questions freely**: There are no silly questions in an unconference setting. Smart, accomplished people ask lots of questions, and your questions help others feel comfortable participating too

**Session leadership best practices:**
If you're leading a session, follow two golden rules:
1. **Keep the conversation moving, progressing, and evolving** - Gently redirect participants who go off-topic or dominate discussion
2. **Try to ensure everyone gets a chance to speak** - Actively invite quieter participants to contribute

**Self-care during the event:**
- **Stay refreshed**: Unconferences can be exhausting. Drink plenty of water, eat a good breakfast, and have a solid lunch. Use coffee strategically but don't overdo it
- **Take comprehensive notes**: Focus on key principles and lessons rather than trying to transcribe everything. Note down interesting people and their contact information
- **Share your insights**: Consider writing a blog post about your experience afterward to help other attendees and future participants

Remember: participants create the value of an unconference through their engagement, openness, and willingness to both share and learn.

## Choosing the right venue for your unconference üèõÔ∏è

Successful unconferences need flexible, welcoming spaces that encourage collaboration. You don't need expensive venues‚Äîyou need adaptable ones.

### Essential venue features ‚ú®

- **Large assembly space**: One room where all participants can gather for opening, agenda-building, and closing activities
- **Multiple breakout areas**: At least 3-5 separate spaces for simultaneous small group discussions
- **Wall space for scheduling**: Areas where you can post session topics and build the collaborative schedule
- **Flexible furniture**: Moveable chairs and tables that can be rearranged for different group sizes

### Valuable additional features üéÅ

- **Reliable Wi-Fi**: Enables participants to share resources and stay connected
- **Accessible restrooms**: Ensures all community members can participate comfortably
- **Kitchen or refreshment area**: Space for coffee, water, and light snacks
- **Quiet spaces**: Areas for one-on-one conversations or small group planning
- **Clear signage**: Helps participants navigate between session spaces

### Ideal venue types üè†

Many successful unconferences happen in community-accessible spaces. Public libraries offer neutral, welcoming environments with multiple meeting rooms. Community centers foster local engagement and often have kitchen facilities. University campuses provide flexible layouts and technological infrastructure. Coworking spaces appeal to innovation-focused audiences, while community organization offices can signal grassroots authenticity.

## Creating safe and inclusive spaces ü§ù

Every participant should feel welcome, safe, and able to contribute authentically. Building inclusive unconferences requires intentional planning and consistent modeling of respectful behavior.

### Establishing community guidelines üìú

Before your event, develop and share a Code of Conduct like the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://citizencodeofconduct.org/). Include these guidelines in your invitations, on your website, and posted visibly in your meeting space.

Your community agreement should address:

- Treating all participants with kindness and respect
- Welcoming diverse perspectives and experiences
- Zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Encouraging participants to speak up if they witness harmful behavior
- Clear process for reporting concerns to organizers
- Commitment to accessibility and inclusion

Review these guidelines at the beginning of your event, and model respectful behavior throughout the day.

**Additional inclusivity considerations:** Always help with introductions when you suspect people don't know each other. If everyone helps introduce everyone else, the entire audience gets to know each other more quickly, creating a more welcoming environment for all participants.

## Types of civic and community unconferences üèôÔ∏è

The unconference model adapts well to various community engagement and civic participation goals:

- [CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/): Civic engagement, local government innovation, and community problem-solving
- [Transparency Camp](https://sunlightfoundation.com/transparency-camp/how-to/): Government accountability, open data, and democratic participation
- [EdCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdCamp): Educational innovation, teaching strategies, and learning community building
- [BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp): Technology innovation, digital tools, and creative collaboration
- Democracy Labs: Policy innovation, electoral reform, and political engagement
- Community Organizing Unconferences: Social justice initiatives, advocacy strategies, and movement building
- Neighborhood Planning Events: Local development, housing issues, and community design

Each maintains the core unconference principles while focusing on specific community needs and interests.

## Why communities choose unconferences üíú

Unconferences create unique value for both participants and organizers:

- **Low barrier to participation**: No expertise requirements‚Äîjust curiosity and willingness to engage
- **Democratic voice and choice**: Participants shape the agenda based on their real interests and needs
- **Accessible to organize**: Minimal advance planning and lower costs than traditional conferences
- **Authentic connections**: Small group discussions foster genuine relationships and ongoing collaboration
- **Inclusive by design**: Format naturally accommodates diverse learning styles and participation preferences
- **Responsive to community needs**: Content emerges from what participants actually want to discuss

This format particularly appeals to community organizers, educators, civic activists, local government staff, and anyone interested in collaborative approaches to social change.

## Sample unconference day schedule üìÖ

Here's a tested timeline that works well for full-day community unconferences:

| Time | Activity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 9:00 AM | Arrival and welcome | Coffee, name tags, informal networking |
| 9:30 AM | Opening circle | Introductions, unconference overview, community guidelines |
| 10:00 AM | Collaborative agenda building | Topic suggestions, schedule creation, room assignments |
| 10:30 AM | First session block | Initial discussions in breakout groups |
| 11:15 AM | Second session block | New topics or continued conversations |
| 12:00 PM | Lunch break | Shared meal, informal networking, one-on-one conversations |
| 1:00 PM | Third session block | Afternoon discussions, action planning sessions |
| 1:45 PM | Final session block | Follow-up conversations, resource sharing |
| 2:30 PM | Closing circle | Reflections, commitments, next steps, appreciation |

Adjust timing based on your community's needs‚Äîsome groups prefer shorter, more intensive formats while others benefit from longer, more reflective sessions.

## Frequently asked questions about unconferences ‚ùì

### How many people should attend an unconference?

Unconferences work well with 15-200 participants. CityCamp events typically host 50-100 attendees, allowing for diverse session topics while maintaining intimate discussion groups. Smaller events (15-30 people) create more intimate conversations, while larger gatherings offer more diverse perspectives and session options.

### What's the difference between an unconference and a traditional conference?

Traditional conferences feature predetermined speakers, fixed agendas, and passive audiences. Unconferences are participant-driven, with attendees proposing topics and leading discussions based on collective interests and expertise. Everyone is both teacher and learner.

### Do I need to be an expert to lead an unconference session?

Absolutely not. Some of the most valuable sessions are led by people asking great questions rather than providing answers. You might propose a session because you're facing a challenge and want community input, or because you have an idea to explore collaboratively.

### How do you handle difficult participants or off-topic discussions?

The "law of two feet" naturally handles most issues‚Äîif a session isn't working, people can leave. For more serious concerns, having clear community guidelines and designated organizers helps address problems quickly and fairly. **Session leaders can gently redirect participants who wander off-topic by politely asking them to return to the core conversation. Most people respond well to this gentle guidance.**

### Can unconferences work for specific policy issues or serious civic matters?

Yes. Many unconferences address significant community challenges like housing policy, educational equity, environmental justice, and local government reform. The format's collaborative nature often generates more innovative solutions than traditional meetings.

### How do you ensure productive outcomes from informal discussions?

Encourage session leaders to designate note-takers, end with concrete next steps, and share contact information. Many successful unconferences result in ongoing working groups, policy proposals, and collaborative projects that continue long after the event.

## Case study: CityCamp Raleigh - from Twitter idea to 200+ attendees üìà

CityCamp Raleigh demonstrates how passionate volunteers can organize a successful unconference from scratch in just 12 weeks. The event began with a simple Twitter conversation in March 2011 between community members discussing how to make Raleigh an open source hub.

**The organizing team faced significant challenges:** None of the organizers had ever attended a CityCamp or any unconference before. Despite this inexperience, their shared passion for open government, transparency, and civic technology drove them to create a three-day event focused on reimagining how technology could improve their city.

**Key organizing decisions that led to success:**

- **Co-leadership structure**: Two committed leaders shared the organizing burden rather than relying on a single organizer
- **Weekly meetups**: Regular in-person gatherings kept momentum and accountability
- **Committee structure**: Teams focused on marketing, sponsorship, speakers, and logistics
- **Transparent planning**: They published their project plan publicly for community input and accountability
- **Strategic communication tools**: Used Facebook groups for primary communication and Google Docs for collaborative work
- **Community research**: Studied other CityCamps and consulted with CityCamp founders for guidance

**Results achieved:**
- Over 200 registrants
- 20 sponsors and supporters
- 15 speakers
- Strong foundation for ongoing civic engagement in Raleigh

The organizers noted that using Facebook as their primary communication tool initially seemed unconventional but proved highly effective for collaboration and keeping everyone informed across multiple committees.

**Key lesson**: The organizers reflected that "opportunities like this don't come along very often" and saw CityCamp as a catalyst for broader open government movement in their city. Their experience shows that passionate community members can successfully organize impactful unconferences even without prior experience, when they combine clear vision with collaborative organizing methods.
