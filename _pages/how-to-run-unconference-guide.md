An unconference is a participant-driven meeting format where attendees collaboratively create the agenda, lead sessions, and shape discussions around shared interests. Unlike traditional conferences with predetermined speakers and rigid schedules, unconferences harness collective intelligence to address real community challenges and foster meaningful civic engagement.

This format has proven particularly effective for civic engagement, community organizing, and collaborative problem-solving. CityCamp events worldwide use this approach to bring together citizens, activists, educators, designers, and government officials to improve local communities through open dialogue and collective action.

## What is an unconference: definition and core principles üéØ

An unconference is a meeting with no set speakers or predetermined agenda. Instead, people come together, suggest topics based on their interests and expertise, and participate in open sessions. Anyone can lead a discussion or join one that interests them.

These participant-driven events are used around the world‚Äîin schools, community organizations, government offices, and civic groups. [CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/) is one popular example focused on local civic engagement and community problem-solving through collaborative discussion and action planning.

## Benefits of organizing unconferences for communities and organizations üå±

Unconferences excel at fostering genuine dialogue, collaborative problem-solving, and building stronger community networks. They create space for voices that might not be heard in traditional meeting formats.

They're accessible to organize. You don't need keynote speakers, elaborate staging, or extensive advance planning. People who attend shape the content together, making every event unique and responsive to current community needs.

Unconferences are particularly effective for:
- Improving cities and local government engagement ([CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/))
- Educational innovation and peer learning ([EdCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdCamp))
- Technology and innovation discussions ([BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp))
- Government transparency and civic participation ([Transparency Camp](https://sunlightfoundation.com/transparency-camp/how-to/))
- Community organizing and social justice initiatives
- Neighborhood planning and local development

## Unconference format: step-by-step process guide üîÑ

Here's what typically happens at a successful unconference:

1. **Gathering and Topic Generation:** Participants arrive and suggest session topics based on their interests, challenges, or expertise
2. **Collaborative Scheduling:** Ideas are posted on a visible wall or board, and a schedule is built together through group discussion
3. **Session Formation:** Participants self-organize into discussion groups around the topics that most interest them
4. **Open Dialogue:** Sessions begin with anyone able to lead and anyone free to join, leave, or move between discussions

No formal presentations required‚Äîjust authentic conversations and collaborative thinking. If a session isn't valuable for you, you can leave and try another. This flexibility is known as the "law of two feet."

## Core principles and guidelines for unconferences ‚öñÔ∏è

- **Whoever shows up are the right people:** The participants present are exactly who should be there
- **Whatever happens is what was meant to happen:** Embrace the organic nature of discussions
- **It starts when it starts:** Allow natural timing rather than rigid schedules
- **The law of two feet:** If you're not learning or contributing, move to another session
- **No spectators, only participants:** Everyone is encouraged to engage actively
- **No pitching or selling:** This is a space for sharing knowledge and building community, not promoting products or services

## Complete organizer guide: planning your unconference üõ†Ô∏è

Running an unconference requires less advance planning than traditional conferences but benefits from thoughtful preparation. Here's your step-by-step organizing guide:

### Before your event: planning phase üìã

- **Define Your Focus:** Choose a theme that will attract engaged participants (civic engagement, education innovation, community development, local government reform)
- **Secure Your Venue:** Find a location with flexible spaces and moveable furniture (see venue selection guide below)
- **Build Your Community:** Spread the word through local networks, community organizations, and social media, clearly explaining the unconference format
- **Establish Safety Guidelines:** Create and share a Code of Conduct that ensures all participants feel welcome and safe
- **Gather Essential Supplies:** Stock up on sticky notes, markers, masking tape, flip chart paper, name tags, and basic refreshments

### During your event: facilitation üé™

- **Welcome and Orientation:** Explain the unconference format and review community guidelines with all participants
- **Collaborative Agenda Building:** Facilitate the process of topic suggestion and schedule creation
- **Maintain Open Atmosphere:** Keep the environment welcoming and encourage participation from quieter voices
- **Support Session Leaders:** Help discussions get started and provide gentle guidance when needed
- **Document the Experience:** Take photos (with permission) and notes to share with the community afterward

### After your event: follow-up üåà

- **Express Gratitude:** Thank participants, venue hosts, and any sponsors or supporters
- **Share Resources:** Distribute session notes, contact information, and relevant links from discussions
- **Gather Feedback:** Ask participants what worked well and what could be improved for future events
- **Maintain Momentum:** Keep your community connected through follow-up meetings, online groups, or collaborative projects

## Maximizing participant engagement and experience üöÄ

The success of your unconference depends on active, engaged participants. Here's how to help attendees make the most of the experience:

### Tips for participants üí°

- **Come with Curiosity:** Bring your questions, challenges, and genuine interest in learning from others
- **Contribute Your Voice:** Don't hesitate to suggest a session topic, even if you don't consider yourself an expert
- **Practice Flexibility:** Move between sessions freely to find the conversations that most interest you
- **Document and Connect:** Take notes, exchange contact information, and ask thoughtful questions
- **Lead by Example:** You don't need credentials to facilitate a valuable discussion‚Äîjust genuine interest and good questions

Remember: participants create the value of an unconference through their engagement, openness, and willingness to both share and learn.

## Choosing the right venue for your unconference üèõÔ∏è

Successful unconferences need flexible, welcoming spaces that encourage collaboration. You don't need expensive venues‚Äîyou need adaptable ones.

### Essential venue features ‚ú®

- **Large Assembly Space:** One room where all participants can gather for opening, agenda-building, and closing activities
- **Multiple Breakout Areas:** At least 3-5 separate spaces for simultaneous small group discussions
- **Wall Space for Scheduling:** Areas where you can post session topics and build the collaborative schedule
- **Flexible Furniture:** Moveable chairs and tables that can be rearranged for different group sizes

### Valuable additional features üéÅ

- **Reliable Wi-Fi:** Enables participants to share resources and stay connected
- **Accessible Restrooms:** Ensures all community members can participate comfortably
- **Kitchen or Refreshment Area:** Space for coffee, water, and light snacks
- **Quiet Spaces:** Areas for one-on-one conversations or small group planning
- **Clear Signage:** Helps participants navigate between session spaces

### Ideal venue types üè†

Many successful unconferences happen in community-accessible spaces. Public libraries offer neutral, welcoming environments with multiple meeting rooms. Community centers foster local engagement and often have kitchen facilities. University campuses provide flexible layouts and technological infrastructure. Coworking spaces appeal to innovation-focused audiences, while community organization offices can signal grassroots authenticity.

## Creating safe and inclusive spaces ü§ù

Every participant should feel welcome, safe, and able to contribute authentically. Building inclusive unconferences requires intentional planning and consistent modeling of respectful behavior.

### Establishing community guidelines üìú

Before your event, develop and share a Code of Conduct like the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://citizencodeofconduct.org/). Include these guidelines in your invitations, on your website, and posted visibly in your meeting space.

Your community agreement should address:
- Treating all participants with kindness and respect
- Welcoming diverse perspectives and experiences
- Zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Encouraging participants to speak up if they witness harmful behavior
- Clear process for reporting concerns to organizers
- Commitment to accessibility and inclusion

Review these guidelines at the beginning of your event, and model respectful behavior throughout the day.

## Sample unconference day schedule üìÖ

Here's a tested timeline that works well for full-day community unconferences:

| Time | Activity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 9:00 AM | Arrival and Welcome | Coffee, name tags, informal networking |
| 9:30 AM | Opening Circle | Introductions, unconference overview, community guidelines |
| 10:00 AM | Collaborative Agenda Building | Topic suggestions, schedule creation, room assignments |
| 10:30 AM | First Session Block | Initial discussions in breakout groups |
| 11:15 AM | Second Session Block | New topics or continued conversations |
| 12:00 PM | Lunch Break | Shared meal, informal networking, one-on-one conversations |

Adjust timing based on your community's needs‚Äîsome groups prefer shorter, more intensive formats while others benefit from longer, more reflective sessions.

## Frequently asked questions about unconferences ‚ùì

### How many people should attend an unconference?
Unconferences work well with 15-200 participants. CityCamp events typically host 50-100 attendees, allowing for diverse session topics while maintaining intimate discussion groups. Smaller events (15-30 people) create more intimate conversations, while larger gatherings offer more diverse perspectives and session options.

### What's the difference between an unconference and a traditional conference?
Traditional conferences feature predetermined speakers, fixed agendas, and passive audiences. Unconferences are participant-driven, with attendees proposing topics and leading discussions based on collective interests and expertise. Everyone is both teacher and learner.

### Do I need to be an expert to lead an unconference session?
Absolutely not. Some of the most valuable sessions are led by people asking great questions rather than providing answers. You might propose a session because you're facing a challenge and want community input, or because you have an idea to explore collaboratively.

### How do you handle difficult participants or off-topic discussions?
The "law of two feet" naturally handles most issues‚Äîif a session isn't working, people can leave. For more serious concerns, having clear community guidelines and designated organizers helps address problems quickly and fairly.

### Can unconferences work for specific policy issues or serious civic matters?
Yes. Many unconferences address significant community challenges like housing policy, educational equity, environmental justice, and local government reform. The format's collaborative nature often generates more innovative solutions than traditional meetings.

### How do you ensure productive outcomes from informal discussions?
Encourage session leaders to designate note-takers, end with concrete next steps, and share contact information. Many successful unconferences result in ongoing working groups, policy proposals, and collaborative projects that continue long after the event.
