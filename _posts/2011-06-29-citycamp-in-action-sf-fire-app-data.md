The fourth of [CityCamp&#8217;s four goals](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/about/ "About CityCamp") is:

> Create outcomes that participants will act upon after the event is over

In the case of [CityCamp San Francisco](http://citycampsf.govfresh.com), participants created outcomes _during_ the event by curating data describing AED locations throughout the city. AEDs are _automated external difibrillators_, those devices you see in airports that can be used by just about anyone to stabilize cardiac arrest victims. AED locations are important data that can save lives, particularly if they are open and portable. Curating this data is non-trivial, however. Collecting AED locations is labor intensive. Mistakes in data can cost lives. Data provided by the City of San Francisco is a decade old in some cases. Some places you&#8217;d expect to find an AED don&#8217;t have one.

So the challenge arises: _how do we fix this_?

Thanks to smart folks who came to CityCampSF, that question is being answered.
