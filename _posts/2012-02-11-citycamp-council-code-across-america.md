## CityCamp Council

This coming Tuesday we&#8217;re having a kickoff meeting of organizers for the world CityCamp Council planned for this year. I&#8217;m stoked that we&#8217;ll have 12 participants that include representatives from all 4 countries where there have been CityCamps: US, UK, Russia, and Canada. Three members of the org team are from government.

## Code Across America

From 24 February through 4 March CityCampers, Open Gov-ers, Code for America fellows, and other civic-minded hackers will participate in a national week of civic innovation. We&#8217;ll deploy apps, liberate data, and share the skills we need to build a civic web.
