Alpha CityCamper Andre Natta (@acnatta) reminded me on Twitter that it&#8217;sÂ been 3 years since the inaugural CityCamp:  
<http://barcamp.org/w/page/25504543/CityCamp-Original>

In that time there have been 30 CityCamps independently organized BY YOU in  
25 cities across 8 countries and 5 continents:

Always a fun time to scroll back through the Introductions thread&#8230;

&#8230;and look way back on the CityCamp Tumblr:
