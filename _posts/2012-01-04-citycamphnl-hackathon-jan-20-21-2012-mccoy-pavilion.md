    We’ve been asked the question: What are the rules for the hackathon and what will the judging be based on? Granted as we try to objectify a process that is somewhat subjective we may not please everyone. These rules are meant to be inclusive and provide the means for broad participation:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Apps need to have some connection to Hawaii.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apps can be based on open source software from other cities but need to be customized for Hawaii.
    </li>
    <li>
      Teams can be from anywhere but need to present at CityCampHNL Hackathon to qualify for prizes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Teams can be individuals, company employees, City employees or a combination thereof.
    </li>
    <li>
      Teams can form now (i.e. immediately), before the hackathon event.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work on applications and ideas can start now but will conclude at 3:00pm on Jan. 21, 2012.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no restriction on team size, but teams need to be clear who is on their team.
    </li>
    <li>
      If code used is open source it should be made available to the open source community.
    </li>
    <li>
      If code is 100% proprietary to the team it can remain proprietary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mobile apps, web apps, APIs and idea strategies (e.g. work on API ordnance) will be judged equally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mashups with external webservices (like Flickr, Google Maps, etc) are allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Teams will have 10 minutes to present their apps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Judging will be based working prototype, user interface, depth of concept, impact of application.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    For those concerned about prize money. The prize money is from CityCampHNL sponsors. The City & County of Honolulu is not involved with any financial transaction between CityCampHNL and the respective teams nor has any financial responsibility with any potential awardees.
  </p>

    As always we welcome your comments and suggestions. Most of all we encourage your ongoing participation. Mahalo!
