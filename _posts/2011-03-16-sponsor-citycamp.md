I&#8217;m glad to report that we&#8217;ve rolled out means to direct financial and in-kind support to local organizers. Thanks (again) to <a title="about" href="http://forums.e-democracy.org/about/" target="_blank">e-democracy.org</a>, CityCamp now has a registered 501.3 (c), not-for-profit, fiscal agent. The recently published [Sponsor Prospectus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjbDoSZMit8ESJMbXZQGnJnGpqO-AqV7MBRFwRNUaAM/edit?hl=en) provides overview and details for how individuals, companies, and non-profits can make tax-deductible contributions through direct payments and sponsorship packages. The purpose of this action is to create a modest fund that will be used to boot-strap CityCamp activities world wide.

Most funds will be distributed to CityCamps in the form of grants to local organizers who agree to host a CityCamp and meet the [expected criteria](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/start-a-camp/). Some funds will be used for coordination and collaboration activies for all CityCamps, including the CityCamp web site(s), the forum, administration, and special events.

Our approach is to provide just enough structure and support to grow and sustain CityCamp and not a bit more.  We want to make it easier for CityCamps to happen by helping to raise the funds and other resources necessary. Local organizers aren&#8217;t required to use this sponsorship program.  CityCamp is still an &#8220;[open source brand](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/about/#brand "about").&#8221; Anyone is free to use the Sponsor Prospectus for their own CityCamp fundraising.  The only requirements for using the CityCamp Sponsor Prospectus are to 1) agree to the &#8220;[Start-A-Camp](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/start-a-camp/ "start-a-camp")&#8221; criteria and 2) reference the  source prospectus URL.

I hope that you, dear reader, will do what you can to support CityCamp.
