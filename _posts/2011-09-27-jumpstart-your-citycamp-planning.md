## Helping other CityCamps with Documentation

There is a lot of momentum for <a title="CityCamp" href="../" target="_blank">CityCamp</a>. We’re seeing other cities planning CityCamps in Denver, Minneapolis, and Honolulu (and more on the way). I’ve gotten a chance to interact with a few of the planners from some of these camps and give them tips & tricks on what worked well here at CityCamp Raleigh and some gotchas that we ran into.

As I’ve been talking with folks, one of the things they find most valuable is our documentation. Because we open sourced our project plan, sponsorship kit, logistics, and many other assets created along the way, other CityCamps are able to get going faster. They are able to re-purpose the work that we did and apply it to their camp. That’s the power of open source.

To make it easier, here is a list of documents from <a title="CityCamp Raleigh" href="http://citycampral.org/" target="_blank">CityCamp Raleigh</a> that may help other folks starting or even considering putting on a CityCamp:<!--more-->
