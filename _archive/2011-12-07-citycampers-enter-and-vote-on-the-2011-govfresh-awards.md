Every day, tech-minded citizens across the country are doing good by their communities, literally geeking out about how they can help re-define the relationship government has with its citizens, using technology as a democratic tool to collaboratively empower both.

So much is happening in the civic technology community &#8211; website redesigns, new websites, open data initiatives, apps, camps, developer contests, hackathons and more &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to get a perspective on or truly appreciate the collective work of these dot-dogooders both inside and outside government.

That&#8217;s why we created the [2011 GovFresh Awards](http://awards.govfresh.com).

It&#8217;s time to recognize and honor all that&#8217;s been accomplished this year. 

It&#8217;s time to say thank you.
