Who says open source is all about code and hackathons have to stick to computer hacking? <a title="Code Across America" href="../code-across-america-a-week-of-civic-innovation/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">Code Across America</a> is a different kind of open source community, and it came together on February 25, 2012. This effort was part of civic innovation week (February 24-March 4), where over a dozen cities in the United States had citizens organize to improve their cities and communities. Simultaneous events included hackathons, unconferences, meet-ups, and Code for America ’brigades’ deploying existing open source applications. This is a story about building community knowledge the <a title="open source way" href="http://opensource.com/open-source-way" rel="nofollow" target="blank">open source way</a>, using the open source platform <a title="LocalWiki" href="http://localwiki.org/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">LocalWiki</a>.

<h2>
  Triangle Wiki Day is an open source success in community building
</h2>

On <a title="Triangle Wiki Day" href="http://citycampral.org/2012/02/triangle-wiki-call-for-contributors/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">Triangle Wiki Day</a>, around 50 people <a title="Triangle Wiki Day a Huge Success for Open Source in Raleigh" href="http://southwestraleigh.com/2012/02/triangle-wiki-day-a-huge-success-for-open-source-in-raleigh/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">collaborated</a> at Red Hat headquarters in Raleigh, NC. The event was a soft launch of <a title="trianglewiki.org" href="http://trianglewiki.org/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">trianglewiki.org</a>, an effort to document information about the Triangle region and increase collaboration and knowledge-sharing across the area. The wiki uses open source software, LocalWiki, as a content management platform. It includes wiki pages, images, and mapping.

The day started off with a brief <a title="presentation" href="http://hibbets.net/pdf/triwikiday_feb25.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="blank">presentation</a> [PDF] on how the Triangle Wiki project has roots in <a title="CityCamp Raleigh" href="http://citycampral.org/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">CityCamp Raleigh</a>. It’s also part of the larger open government movement and part of the Code Across America civic innovation week.

Raleigh At-large City Councilor <a title="Mary Ann Baldwin" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/maryannbaldwin/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mary Ann Baldwin</a> gave a keynote at the event. She spoke briefly on the importance of collaborating on a project like Triangle Wiki and how events like this continue to be an authentic part of Raleigh&#8217;s open source philosophy and open-minded communities. At-large City Councilor Russ Stephenson and Raleigh Planning Director <a title="Mitchell Silver" href="http://twitter.com/mitchell_silver" rel="nofollow" target="blank">Mitchell Silver</a> were also in attendance.

<a title="Reid Serozi" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/reidserozi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reid Serozi</a>, Triangle Wiki project lead, provided the background on LocalWiki, showing a <a title="LocalWiki - collaborative, community-owned local medi" href="http://vimeo.com/12555175" rel="nofollow" target="blank">video</a> from <a title="Philip Neustrom" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/philipn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Philip Neustrom</a>. Neustrom is one of the LocalWiki co-founders and worked extensively with <a title="daviswiki.org" href="http://daviswiki.org/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">daviswiki.org</a>. Serozi walked the attendees through wiki 101—teaching them how to register an account, create new pages, and edit existing pages. After that, the edit party began.

Right away, people started creating pages, collaborating with each other, and helping one another with wiki best practices, formatting, mapping, and more. The group made a lot of progress.

I spoke with Councilor Baldwin at the end of the day. She was a little intimidated at the start, but is now comfortable making contributions on her own. She <a title="created several pages" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/maryannbaldwin/status/173461932332941312" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">created several pages</a>, practicing with a page about the Cotton Mill before contributing several pages mapping assets for Raleigh.

Serozi was pleased with the turnout and participation. His reaction on the day:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    As I was setting up for the Triangle Wiki Day event, there were so many unknowns. As the event started, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the seats taken, power strips full with dozens of laptops ready to partake in an open content edit party. During the event and afterwards, it became pretty clear the efforts produced from Triangle Wiki Day will have a ripple effect within our community.
  </p>
</blockquote>

What did this community accomplish? Here are a few of the results from Triangle Wiki Day:

<ul>
  <li>
    633 page edits
  </li>
  <li>
    100 maps
  </li>
  <li>
    138 new photos added
  </li>
</ul>

Neustrom was watching from afar. He knows the wiki software he works on is just an enabler. &#8220;I think the Triangle Wiki day was a spectacular success,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It really shows the true potential of this new form of collaborative local media.&#8221;

The next step for the Triangle Wiki is to capitalize on this event. “The challenge for everyone involved at this point is to continue the momentum and reach 1,000 pages by the March 14 public launch,” said Serozi.

<h2>
  More about LocalWiki from their co-founder
</h2>

Neustrom wants LocalWiki to be more than a collaborative open source project. He feels that the freedom that this platform offers will be a key to getting people to share information and knowledge in the future:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Right now we&#8217;re at point where it&#8217;s unclear how people in our local communities will get and share information in the future.  And, more critically, many large corporations would like to be the gatekeeper of this local information. The LocalWiki movement represents a truly open alternative to an increasingly consolidated, closed-off local information ecology.
  </p>

  <p>
    The civic world has focused a lot on the problem of open data–and open data is really important.  But open data alone won&#8217;t satiate our communities&#8217; information needs. We need tools and organizations that can really pull everything together and provide context, provide a more qualitative take on local information. And I think LocalWiki is really well-positioned to help in this respect.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  Conclusion
</h2>

The power of open source and collaboration were evident at Triangle Wiki Day. This project is about creating a community anyone with local knowledge can contribute to. It brings together people with different skillsets—ranging from tech-savvy know-how to photography, local history to hackers, and much more. You don’t have to code or contribute upstream to add your knowledge to the wiki, you just need to click the edit button. After that, you’re part of an open source community and a philosophy that is changing the world.
