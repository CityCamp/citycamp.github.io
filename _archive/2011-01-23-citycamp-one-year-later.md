Today and tomorrow, January 23 & 24, mark one year since [the first CityCamp](barcamp.org/CityCamp-Original "barcamp wiki") in Chicago, Illinois.  As is customary, it&#8217;s time to take time to reflect on what has transpired in the year since that fateful weekend.

Here&#8217;s a little CityCamp &#8220;By the Numbers&#8221;:

# 6

The number of [cities](http://citycamp.govfresh.com/cities/ "cities") that have held a CityCamp

# 900

Roughly the number of people who attended CityCamps last year.  (About twice as many registered, which means they at least visited our pages.)

# 504

The combined number of members in CityCamp forum at [e-democracy](http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/citycamp/ "e-dem forum") and group at [GovLoop](http://www.govloop.com/group/citycamp "GovLoop group"). (**956** [Facebook fans](http://www.facebook.com/citycamp "Facebook").)

# 800
