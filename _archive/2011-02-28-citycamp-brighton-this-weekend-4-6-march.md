_**Friday 4th March – Sunday 6th March 2011**_  
 _[  
CityCampBTN](http://www.citycampbtn.org/) is about rethinking the way the web, technology and participation will shape the future of our city._

_It doesn’t matter whether you’re someone with a great idea or a problem to solve, or if you’re a developer with specific skills – if you’re passionate about our city and want to be inspired to create new solutions, then this is for you._

_We’ve lined up three days of inspiring speakers, discussions powered by you and hands-on building of solutions. And it’s free._

_Part of the [CityCamp](http://www.citycamp.com/) movement, started in Chicago last year, CityCamp BTN brings together local government, business, community sector and academic communities, to work together._
