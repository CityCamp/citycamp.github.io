_My biggest takeaways:_ 

<div>
  <p>
    <em> It&#8217;s essential to get a good mix of perspective. We had civil servants, vendors, journalists, non-profits, and citizens. It would not have been as successful if it was gov-to-gov, vendor-to-vendor, or even gov-to-vendor.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>It&#8217;s essential that the conversation not revolve entirely around tech and data. In 2010 we can assume that technology and data are involved. We&#8217;re just scratching the surface on process. And the processes involved are not just about methods and means for collecting-publishing-visualizing data. Providing greater opportunities to get citizens&#8217; voices heard and to increase their engagement in civic duty is important.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>There is a new and important role for journalism: tell the stories behind the tech and the data. However, journalists may not have the education and knowledge to do this well. Interpreting stats is hard. I am excited to see Global Integrity stepping up to start a &#8220;help desk&#8221; specifically to work this problem. I think there is a new &#8220;extreme programming&#8221; model that papers could adopt; or perhaps to put it in terms papers already understand: pair your journalists up with data-viz-stats people like you pair them up with photographers.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>People want what City Camp provided. We are going to learn from it, refine it, and keep it going.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Don&#8217;t wait for me or Jen to keep City Camp going. Anyone can do this anywhere at anytime. Copy what works. Adapt for your local perspective. Just do it</em>.
