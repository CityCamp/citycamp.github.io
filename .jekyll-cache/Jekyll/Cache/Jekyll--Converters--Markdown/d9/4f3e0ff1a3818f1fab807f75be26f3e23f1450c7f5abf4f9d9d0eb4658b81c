<blockquote>
  <p>one of our amazing sponsors, theÂ <a href="http://www.aldridgefoundation.com/">Aldridge Foundation</a>, has agreed to put up a <strong>ten thousand pound prize fund</strong> to implement the best innovation we create at CityCamp.</p>

  <p>Weâ€™re very pleased and proud that the Foundation has given us, and the cityâ€™s innovators, that level of commitment. Most of all weâ€™re hugely excited to be able to turn some of the ambitions and ideas of CityCamp into real, delivered change.</p>

  <p>The full details of the prize will be announced on the day, but it will take the form of a development fund to help the team behind the best idea work with the relevant public services over six months to deliver their vision.</p>
