I"u<p>As part of our efforts to promote the CityCamp Word Tour, we’re working with <a href="http://govfresh.com">GovFresh</a> to create this new hub for all things CityCamp.</p>

<p>There’s still an open <a href="http://barcamp.org/CityCamp">barcamp wiki</a> and a <a href="http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/citycamp">public forum</a>. This site brings it all together through a common portal with a great look and feel. In fact, our hope is that this site will help establish CityCamp as an ‘<a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/citycamp-as-an-open-source-brand/">open source brand</a>,’ something that is both easily repeatable and recognizable for anyone to use. That’s why we put CityCamp in the Creative Commons. There will be a few rules to follow, but as few as possible. We haven’t completely worked out those details but didn’t want to wait to get started.</p>
