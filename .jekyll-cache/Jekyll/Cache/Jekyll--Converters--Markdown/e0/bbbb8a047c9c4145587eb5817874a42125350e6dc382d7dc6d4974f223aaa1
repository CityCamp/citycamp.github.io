I"…<p>I‚Äôm glad to report that we‚Äôve rolled out means to direct financial and in-kind support to local organizers. Thanks (again) to <a title="about" href="http://forums.e-democracy.org/about/" target="_blank">e-democracy.org</a>, CityCamp now has a registered 501.3 (c), not-for-profit, fiscal agent. The recently published <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjbDoSZMit8ESJMbXZQGnJnGpqO-AqV7MBRFwRNUaAM/edit?hl=en">Sponsor Prospectus</a> provides overview and details for how individuals, companies, and non-profits can make tax-deductible contributions through direct payments and sponsorship packages. The purpose of this action is to create a modest fund that will be used to boot-strap CityCamp activities world wide.</p>

<p>Most funds will be distributed to CityCamps in the form of grants to local organizers who agree to host a CityCamp and meet the <a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/start-a-camp/">expected criteria</a>. Some funds will be used for coordination and collaboration activies for all CityCamps, including the CityCamp web site(s), the forum, administration, and special events.</p>

<p>Our approach is to provide just enough structure and support to grow and sustain CityCamp and not a bit more. ¬†We want to make it easier for CityCamps to happen by helping to raise the funds and other resources necessary. Local organizers aren‚Äôt required to use this sponsorship program. ¬†CityCamp is still an ‚Äú<a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/about/#brand" title="about">open source brand</a>.‚Äù Anyone is free to use the Sponsor Prospectus for their own CityCamp fundraising. ¬†The only requirements for using the CityCamp Sponsor Prospectus are to 1) agree to the ‚Äú<a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/start-a-camp/" title="start-a-camp">Start-A-Camp</a>‚Äù criteria and 2) reference the ¬†source prospectus URL.</p>

<p>I hope that you, dear reader, will do what you can to support CityCamp.</p>
