    I feel very fortunate to have been part of the planning group for CityCamp Raleigh.Â  Although I work for the City of Raleigh, I was part of the team as an average joe â€“ not an â€œofficial city representativeâ€ â€“ which allowed me to do things that have nothing to do with my day-to-day job responsibilities.Â  Sometimes itâ€™s nice to take a break from the everyday routine and shop for post-it notes and markers instead.

    Here are some things I learned from the weekend and the planning that went into it.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      I finally learned the value of Twitter.Â  I have been a Twitter voyeur for some time now and just set up an account a couple months ago.Â  Watching the real-time conversation from the audience about what was going on throughout the weekend made it a much more immersive experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      I learned that there is a passionate group of citizens who are willing to not just talk about the problems our city faces â€“ but are also willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work solving them.
    </li>
    <li>
      I learned that the quality and availability of government data in standard formats is a foundation to lots of great things â€“ namely an enabler to all those tech-savvy citizens who are willing to use that data to solve problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      I learned that personal interaction between citizens and city employees can help city employees get exposure to the folks that ultimately consume our services.Â  As IT folks, sometimes weâ€™re supporting the folks who support the folks who are on the front lines serving the citizens.Â  It always helps to be able to draw a line from where you stand to the people who will eventually be served by your organization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, I got a glimpse of what teamwork the open source way is all about.Â  There were no formal leaders, job descriptions, or top-down direction â€“ just dedicated people who brought their skills to the project and jumped in wherever they could bring the most value.Â  We used technology tools based on their goodness of fit and experienced the freedom that comes from internet-based tools that interoperate with one another.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Iâ€™m looking forward to more interaction throughout the coming year and then another CityCamp Raleigh 2012!
