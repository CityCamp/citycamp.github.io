<p>The fourth of <a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/about/" title="About CityCamp">CityCampâ€™s four goals</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create outcomes that participants will act upon after the event is over</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://citycampsf.govfresh.com">CityCamp San Francisco</a>, participants created outcomes <em>during</em> the event by curating data describing AED locations throughout the city. AEDs are <em>automated external difibrillators</em>, those devices you see in airports that can be used by just about anyone toÂ stabilizeÂ cardiac arrest victims.Â AED locations are important data that can save lives, particularly if they are open and portable. Curating this data is non-trivial, however. Collecting AED locations is labor intensive. Mistakes in data can cost lives. Data provided by the City of San Francisco is a decade old in some cases. Some places youâ€™d expect to find an AED donâ€™t have one.</p>

<p>So the challenge arises: <em>how do we fix this</em>?</p>

<p>Thanks to smart folks who came to CityCampSF, that question is being answered.</p>
