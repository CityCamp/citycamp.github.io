<p><em><strong>Friday 4th March â€“ Sunday 6th March 2011</strong></em><br />
 <em><a href="http://www.citycampbtn.org/"><br />
CityCampBTN</a> is about rethinking the way the web, technology and participation will shape the future of our city.</em></p>

<p><em>It doesnâ€™t matter whether youâ€™re someone with a great idea or a problem to solve, or if youâ€™re a developer with specific skills â€“ if youâ€™re passionate about our city and want to be inspired to create new solutions, then this is for you.</em></p>

<p><em>Weâ€™ve lined up three days of inspiring speakers, discussions powered by you and hands-on building of solutions. And itâ€™s free.</em></p>

<p><em>Part of theÂ <a href="http://www.citycamp.com/">CityCamp</a> movement, started in Chicago last year, CityCamp BTN brings together local government, business, community sector and academic communities, to work together.</em></p>
