I"‹<p>Iâ€™m spending a lot of my CityCamp time these day on two things, 1) Â talking to people in different cities about hosting camps and 2) building out the infrastructure for making CityCamps <a href="http://citycamp.com/about" title="About page">recognizable and repeatable for anyone to use</a>. Â In thinking about what describes the essence of CityCamp, including the 4 Goals, Iâ€™ve realized that most important to me, personally, is the 4th Goal: Â <em>Create outcomes that participants will act upon after the event is over.</em> I want to witness conversations converted into actions. Â That seems like a tremendous task given a relative lack of awareness and understanding of Gov 2.0 at the local level among anyone but early adopters in big, urban markets. Â But itâ€™s not a tremendous task if we talk in concrete terms among people who are positions to enact change. Â Here in my city of Virginia Beach, Virginia I can think of 3 specific examples of what this means.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="calendar-events">Calendar Events</h2>

<p>There are at least two departments in my city that publish event calendars that I care about. Â One is the school system and the other is the cityâ€™s events department. Â For parents and kids with busy schedules, events matter. Â In a tourist town, events matter. Â Because no one from Web 2.0 Land is talking with municipal employees responsible for publishing events, these employees resort to things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manually copying and pasting events from Outlook calendars into Word documents that are attached to manually compiled email lists</li>
  <li>Publishing calendar data as text and images in PDF files</li>
</ul>

<p>City events calendars would be incredibly more useful and easier to publish if they were simply exported from Outlook to iCal files and posted to URLs on the Web. Â Everyone on both sides of the producer/consumer equation will spend less time managing the technology and more time managing the events. Â Lucky for me here in V.B., the Director of Beach Events is a long time friend so itâ€™s easy for me to talk to him about this. Â It turns out in that case the solution requires ZERO cost and ZERO technology investment of any kind. Â His office literally manages events using Microsoft Office Outlook. Â We just have to work through the process change to make this routine. Â The school system is a lot more complicated because there are scores of calendars in use at offices all over the city. Â Here again I am lucky. Â The tech lead responsible the school systemâ€™s intranet is a former colleague from Bridgeborn. Â He also shares my understanding and enthusiasm for making school events more usable and easier to manage through better use of the Web. Â <em>How do a couple of Â one-off connections in two separate departments translate into a better events IT strategy for the whole city?</em></p>

<h2 id="data-publishing">Data Publishing</h2>

<p>Data catalogs <a href="http://wiki.openmuni.org/#Open_Data_Initiatives" title="open muni wiki">are popping up in cities all over</a>. Â Here in my city we are still behind the curve. Â <a href="http://www.vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextoid=8f770d066c0dd010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=6a0a1c17717ec110VgnVCM100000190c640aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default" title="vbgov.com">Crime</a> and school data are published in formats that are not easy to use and reuse. Â A local newspaper has taken up the task of screen-scraping and converting data into tables and databases, which are used to create push-pins-on-maps, headline feeds, and re-formatted web pages for the paperâ€™s online sites. Â No one was taking the next logical step and publishing the data from the source in formats portable enough for further visualizations and analyses. Â So when the editor of my neighborhood section wrote that he was looking for feedback on how the paper could do a better job reporting crime data I was quick to write him back. Â Eventually I was connected with an enterprising programmer who knew just what to do. Â He was sitting on the data. Â He just needed to put an API on it. Â The first cut was done in HOURS. Â I was <a href="http://kevincurry.blogspot.com/2009/10/mashing-up-virginia-beach-police-data.html">mashing it up</a> minutes later. Â <em>But neither of us is talking to anyone in the police department or with the cityâ€™s IT staff responsible for publishing data through city sites.</em></p>

<h2 id="non-emergency-communications-311">Non-Emergency Communications (311)</h2>

<p>Have you heard of the â€œSeeClickFix Effect?â€ Â Tech geeks like me will recognize the analogy to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect" title="wiki">Slashdot Effect</a>. Â The SeeClickFix Effect is when a cityâ€™s non-emergency communications department (311)Â Â is flooded with trouble tickets from the free mobile Web app, <a href="http://seeclickfix.com" title="home page">SeeClickFix</a>. Â Itâ€™s incredibly easy to set up a direct channel from any smart phone to any city email account to file 311 reports that totally circumvent whatever processes and systems are already in place. Â I applaud my city and others that have the â€œcan-doâ€ attitude that any open channel from citizen to gov is a welcome channel. Â To say that further adoption of SeeClickFix is on anyoneâ€™s priority list would be an overstatement, however. Â By talking with the city I was able to learn that the Director of Non-Emergency Communication is open to a discussion about Open 311 and how to leverage the cityâ€™s existing 311 data. Â I have a meeting Thursday, but Iâ€™m no 311 expert. Â <em>Itâ€™s clear that connections that need to be made arenâ€™t being made.</em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-style: normal">So this, </span>via</em> 3 local examples, is what CityCamp is about. Â I want my city to turn innovative success stories into success strategies. Â I want citizen data consumers to talk to city data publishers about value in data for both parties. Â I want people withÂ opportunitiesÂ to connect to people with experience.</p>
