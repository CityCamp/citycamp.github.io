<p>This coming Tuesday we’re having a kickoff meeting of organizers for the world CityCamp Council planned for this year. I’m stoked that we’ll have 12 participants that include representatives from all 4 countries where there have been CityCamps: US, UK, Russia, and Canada. Three members of the org team are from government.</p>

<p>From 24 February through 4 March CityCampers, Open Gov-ers, Code for America fellows, and other civic-minded hackers will participate in a national week of civic innovation. We’ll deploy apps, liberate data, and share the skills we need to build a civic web.</p>
