I"B<p>Today and tomorrow, January 23 &amp; 24, mark one year since <a href="barcamp.org/CityCamp-Original" title="barcamp wiki">the first CityCamp</a> in Chicago, Illinois.  As is customary, it’s time to take time to reflect on what has transpired in the year since that fateful weekend.</p>

<p>Here’s a little CityCamp “By the Numbers”:</p>

<h1 id="6">6</h1>

<p>The number of <a href="http://citycamp.govfresh.com/cities/" title="cities">cities</a> that have held a CityCamp</p>

<h1 id="900">900</h1>

<p>Roughly the number of people who attended CityCamps last year.  (About twice as many registered, which means they at least visited our pages.)</p>

<h1 id="504">504</h1>

<p>The combined number of members in CityCamp forum at <a href="http://forums.e-democracy.org/groups/citycamp/" title="e-dem forum">e-democracy</a> and group at <a href="http://www.govloop.com/group/citycamp" title="GovLoop group">GovLoop</a>. (<strong>956</strong> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/citycamp" title="Facebook">Facebook fans</a>.)</p>
